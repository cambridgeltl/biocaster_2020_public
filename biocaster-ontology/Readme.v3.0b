Biocaster Ontology v3.0b README 

Version 3.0b is still very much a work in progress but is released as a pre-beta in the hope that it will be useful and to solicit feedback and corrections. The known issues we are currently working on are listed below.

More information on the methods and sources used to construct the ontology can be found in:

Issues
------

a) Translation verification

Newly added terms for several languages still need to be verified.  These include: Arabic, French, Indonesian, Korean, Malay, Spanish, Vietnamese and Chinese.  

b) Species identifiers for symptoms

Human symptoms are still being renamed as "symtom (human)".

c) Single species specific diseases

These are currently exceptions to the "disease (species)" naming convention as there is no ambiguity.

d) Terms requiring translation

A few terms still require translation, e.g. Difficulty swallowing (human);  these are under consideration.

e) Animal disease symptoms

We are now working to expand the symptoms for animal diseases in line with veterinary sources.

f) External links

Several require verifying and are now likely stale, including MeSH (e.g. Marek Disease which has a dead link) and Pathport. 

g) SUMO links

Concepts from SUMO need to be properly linked to their SUMO identifiers.

Change Notes 
------------
Version 3.0b:

(1) All disease and symptom terms specific to their groups now have specific suffix labels (e.g., Tularemia (Lagomorph), Rabies (Human)). However, those symptom and disease terms that now have suffix labels still need to have a translated suffix for each language. For example, Athlete foot (Human) still does not have (Human) added to the translated "Athlete foot" in all languages.

(2) Each disease now has corresponding symptoms specific to each animal group (e.g., Tularemia (Lagomorph) has Chills (Lagomorph), Fever (Lagomorph), Lethargy (Lagomorph).

(3) Almost all symptom terms now belong to the specific syndrome(s) (e.g., Conjnctivitis (Bovine) indicates Constitutional Syndrome (Veterinary)).
