The lexicon and rule files in this directory were generated automatically by a script made by John McCrae (University of Bielefeld) from the BioCaster ontology on the 19th April 2010.  Please see later versions of the ontology for updates and corrections.

The files are intended to be used with the Simple Rule Language Editor - a lightweight environment for text mining.  The main page for SRL can be found at http://code.google.com/p/srl-editor/ along with contact information, documentation and a video.
